README
================

These files were used to create the Stuart\_OSM2016 poster.

Because I used power point to create the poster, most of the plots were
created using excel. The maps were created in QGIS using the method
described in the tutorial [Graphics for
Conservation](http://scalar.usc.edu/works/graphics-for-conservation/index).
